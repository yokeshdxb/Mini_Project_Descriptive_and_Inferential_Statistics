# 📊 Mini_Project_Descriptive_and_Inferential_Statistics

A hands-on project to understand and apply key statistics concepts like **mean**, **median**, **mode**, **variance**, **confidence intervals**, and **hypothesis testing** using real-world datasets and manual calculation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is designed to give a practical introduction to both **Descriptive** and **Inferential** Statistics. It helps build foundational statistical thinking by combining theoretical understanding with hands-on practice.

### ✨ Key Concepts Covered

- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
- Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- Confidence Intervals for population parameters
- Hypothesis Testing: Z-test, t-test
- Visualization and interpretation of results
- Real-world datasets and manual calculations for concept clarity

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Colab Notebooks)
- Libraries: NumPy

  ## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Compute and interpret statistical measures manually and with Python
- Construct and interpret confidence intervals
- Perform hypothesis testing and understand p-values
- Apply statistical thinking to real-life datasets
